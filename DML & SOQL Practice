// This is DML and SOQL practice


// Create 10 new Accounts



//Modify the 10 new accounts and set values for NumberofEmployees field, save changes to database


//SOQL query that retrieves the data I just created 


// SOQL query that retrieves 5 accounts with the fewwest number of employees and display in ASC (low to high) order by num of employees.
